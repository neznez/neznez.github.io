<h4>DRP</h4>
<p>From Spring 2019 to Spring 2021, I was one of the co-organizers of the <a href = "https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/drp/index.html">Directed Reading in Math 
program</a>, which pairs undergraduates looking to learn some extra math 
with grad students who want to help them through it, usually by reading a book or paper together. 
I've also participated in the program as a grad student mentor most semesters, leading projects 
in knot theory, hyperbolic geometry, number theory, and differential geometry.</p>

<h4>Sunday Morning Math Group</h4>
<p>I often volounteer at <a href="https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/smmg/index.html">SMMG</a>, a free program for middle schoolers and high schoolers. We 
solve math puzzles and have talks about accessible math topics every other Sunday. I've 
contributed two talks, about the towers of Hanoi and about descriptive hyperbolic geometry.</p>

<h4>Grad Rep</h4>
<p>In the 2020 - 2021 academic year, I was a <a href= "https://sites.google.com/view/utmathgsc">grad rep</a> for the math department, 
a group of students who listen to and communicate grad student concerns and help organize events to address them. 
I was also on the <a href = "https://www.utgsa.net/">Graduate Student Assembly</a>, a body 
of graduate students from across all departments at UT. This academic year, I am a grad rep again.</p>

<h4>Seminars</h4>
<p>In the Spring 2020 semester, I organized the Junior Topology seminar at UT Austin, 
where grad students mostly working in low-dimensional topology and geometric structures 
give talks about their research or math interests. Most semesters I also participate in 
a learning seminar, and in Spring 2019 I helped organize one about Teichmuller theory.</p>
