<p><br>Communicating and teaching mathematics are an important and impactful part of a mathematician's life. 
I strive to do a good job in supporting all my students, and am committed to fostering 
an inclusive and equitable environment in my classroom. Mathematics is for everyone.</p>
<p>Below is a list of courses I've taught or TAed. If you are interested in some  
other ways to bring mathematics to students, check out the <a href="outreach.html">Service & Outreach</a> section of my website.</p>

<h4>Fall 2024</h4>
<p>I am teaching an IBL style "Principles of real analysis" class, course number 351. Details coming soon to its Canvas page!</p>
  
<h4>Fall 2021 - Spring 2023</h4>
<p>I was the assistant instructor for M371E, a class where we discuss teaching strategies and pedagogy with undergraduate learning assistants staffing <a href ="https://www.ma.utexas.edu/academics/undergraduate/calclab">CalcLab</a>. If you're a student in this class, all information about it should be available on its <a href = "https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1340245">Canvas page</a>.</p>

<h4>Summer 2021</h4>
<p>Last Summer, I ran a <a href = "https://web.ma.utexas.edu/SMC/Minicourses.html"> Summer mini-course</a> about measured laminations and train tracks, touching upon how they're used in studying hyperbolic surfaces, three-manifolds, and AdS_3 manifolds. I also contributed a lecture to the group cohomology Summer mini-course. If you'd like notes for either of those, feel free to send me an email about it!</p>

<h4>Spring 2021</h4>
<p>I was not teaching this semester, but I helped supervise an undergrad research group in a 
mathematical visualisation problem. The program is called <a href = "https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/geometry_lab">Texas Geometry Lab</a>, check it out!
 The project was about visualising the Benzecri cocompactness theorem.<p>

<h4>Spring 2020</h4>
<p>I was TAing M 427J (Differential Equations with Linear Algebra) for Professor Heitmann. This 
was the semester when we suddenly went online, and I would like to thank my students for all their 
drawings of dragons in their online submissions.</p>

<h4>Fall 2019</h4>
<p>I was TAing the honors section of M 427L (Advanced Calculus for Applications) for Professor Beckner. This 
class was a lot of fun and covered a ton of interesting material quite rigorously.</p>

<h4>Spring 2019</h4>
<p>I was TAing a section of M 427L, for Professor Shen.</p>

<h4>Fall 2018</h4>
<p>My first TAing job at UT was two secions of M 408C (Differential Calculus) for Professor Wolesensky.</p>
